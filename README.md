weather and Vacation API
This activity is broken down into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy.

## Part 1: WeatherPy OpenWeatherMap API

In this deliverable, We need to create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator using the citipy Python library Links to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap API Links to an external site., and using our problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.

To get started, the code required to generate random geographic coordinates and the nearest city to each latitude and longitude combination is provided.

### Steps 1: Created Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude:

To fulfill the first requirement, we use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list. Next, We created a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

*Latitude vs. Temperature <br>
Latitude vs. Humidity<br>
Latitude vs. Cloudiness<br>
Latitude vs. Wind Speed <br>*

#### Steps 2: Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship

#### To fulfill the second requirement, we computed the linear regression for each relationship. Separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude). 
#### Next, created a series of scatter plots including the linear regression line, the model's formula, and the r values as you can see in the following image:
